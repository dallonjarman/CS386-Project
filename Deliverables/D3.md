## 1. System Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of our system, the problem statement can be described as such: The problem of low-quality **help-ticket *tracking systems*** for IT work affects **employees'** performance on solving issues submitted via **ticket** and the people who are submitting the **tickets**, the impact of which is low quality customer service and slow production of results. From the problem statement, the product position statement can be formed: **The Super Simple Ticketing System** is for employees who want a more efficient work environment for ***tracking* IT requests** (something that tracks and organizes **IT tickets** that can be accessed) and will be quick, user friendly, and effective unlike competitors such as OSTicket, ServiceNow, Peppermint, and Request Tracker. Lastly, the value proposition of this system can be described as: Super Simple Ticketing System is an **IT ticket *tracking* app** for **employees** to efficiently ***manage their clientâ€™s issues***, by providing a simple yet efficient method of tracking and solving issues. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key pieces of this system include stakeholders, requirements, use cases, and user stories that can all be combined and described as follows: The stakeholders in this system are IT **employees** who want a more efficient work flow, users who submit tickets, businesses with IT divisions, us (the creators), and possibly even the competing companies with similar products. These stakeholders all have something to be desired from the product and thus the  functional requirements can be described: the ability to close and create tickets, to sign-in/have an account on the site, to make comments on tickets, assign tickets to departments or individuals, search for **tickets** given email or ID information, and a knowledge base to look up common technical issues and their solutions. The nonfunctional requirements regard speedy response times and reliability; the system should respond to requests in 5 seconds and be able to store **tickets** for assignment without losing track of them. We ultimately want to create a product that can function in three main sects: ticket submission (users can submit a **ticket** by providing a title, description, category and email and can submit multiple), ticket listing (how employees can view the tickets like most recent at the top, etc.), and ticket closing (**tickets** can be ***responded*** to and ***removed*** from list when completed).
