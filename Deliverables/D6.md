#### **1. Introduction**

Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This description should contain the value proposition and the main features. At the end of the introduction, include a link to your project on GitHub.

	Super Simple Ticketing System is a ticketing application that allows IT employees to manage and solve client issues by providing a simple to use and efficient interface. There are three types of users: Regular users, employees and administrators. Regular users are able to submit tickets, as well as search through their closed tickets. Employees can view, update, search for or delete tickets, and administrators can assign tickets to employees.

#### **3. Tests - Hannah Penado**



1. For our automated testing we used pytest
2. GitHub link to folder with tests: [https://github.com/oliveoil222/CS386-Project/tree/main/ssts/backendDB](https://github.com/oliveoil222/CS386-Project/tree/main/ssts/backendDB)
3. GitHub link to example of tests: [https://github.com/oliveoil222/CS386-Project/blob/main/ssts/backendDB/dbTests.py](https://github.com/oliveoil222/CS386-Project/blob/main/ssts/backendDB/dbTests.py)
4.  An output of the pytest program below, the Solutions get function still needs some work as seen below getting an attribute error message that should be fixed soon.

#### **5. Code quality**

We tried to set our standards toward the start of our project, especially when doing GitHub repository stuff. Flask itself also has standards for how the project should be laid out, we tried to adhere to that standard, however, Flask seems to be fine with us having extra files where it doesnâ€™t really control it in the virtual environment.

Another big standard we set for ourselves, pair programming. We used pair programming to maintain code quality, and to try and see how our other half of the team did their programming.

We also followed the PEP8 style guide as best as possible to try and maintain good quality code that looks like a lot of Python code style wise.


#### **6. Lessons learned** 

We learned a lot during the production of our second release, this includes improving our code to make it easier to read and use, providing updates to features, and completely creating extra functionality . We also learned about how to manage our time effectively to meet deadlines. The things we would change if we have more time to develop the product would be cleaning up the code and performing more testing. This is as well as adding more features and conveniences so the consumers have an even better experience. Though, I believe that we completed every task we set out to do in our project.
